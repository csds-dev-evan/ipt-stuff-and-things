##Domain Password Audit Tool##

git clone https://github.com/clr2of8/DPAT

##Your customer.ntds file should be in this format:##
			 domain\username:RID:lmhash:nthash:::
#########################################################

dpat.py -n customer.ntds -c hashcat.potfile -g "Domain Admins.txt" "Enterprise Admins.txt"

##You can get this file by first dumping the password hashes from your domain controller by executing the following command in an administrative command prompt on a domain controller. Just make sure you have enough disk space to store the output in c:\temp. The amount of space needed will be slightly larger than the size of the ntds.dit file that is currently on the disk, as this performs a backup of that file and some registry settings.
