Operating systems are in use that are out of support and pose risk of compromise in their current state. Microsoft typically provides ten years of support for operating systems, with a minimum of five years mainstream support and a minimum of five years extended support at the supported service pack level. PCs running Windows XP and Server 2003 can be vulnerable to viruses, and remote code execution vulnerabilities. Not only are these systems easily compromised, but they can also impact newer versions of Microsoft products, including Windows 7 and Windows 10. Hackers or competitors can infiltrate networks, wreak havoc on infrastructures or steal sensitive information. The impact from unsecured hardware and software can be monumental and include: costly data loss; exposure of corporate and personnel data; pilfering of trade secrets; network failure and legal action. The analyst was able to successfully exploit a flaw in one of these two systems and gain remote code execution. This flaw was fixed with the MS08-067 patch distributed by Microsoft. 

TraceSecurity recommends retiring these end of life systems in favor of operating systems that are still supported by Microsoft.

The analyst identified two out of date operating systems(XP, and Server 2003) with the Metasploit module auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_version. Upon further research, the analyst attempted to exploit them with a well known, public exploit coined as "Microsoft Server Service Relative Path Stack Corruption". This module exploits a parsing flaw in the path canonicalization code of NetAPI32.dll through the Server Service. Remote code execution was gained on the Windows XP machine, where clear text credentials were found using the tool "mimikatz". The analyst attempted to gain access to other systems with these clear-text credentials, but was unsuccessful.
